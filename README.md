# most_frequent_substring
<H1>About</H1>
<body>
A program written in Python as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms II class. This program receives a integer and String as command line input.
  
A password with size N can be found by searching the text for the most frequent substring with N characters.
Given the size of the password and the encoded message, determine the password following the strategy
given above.
To illustrate your task, consider the following example in which the password size is three (N= 3) and the text
message is just ‘baababacb’. The password would then be ‘aba’, because this is the substring with size 3 that
appears most often in the whole text (it appears twice) while the other six different substrings appear only once
(baa; aab; bab; bac; acb).
